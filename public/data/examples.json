    "summary": "This video explains the fundamentals of musical chords, focusing on how to build major, minor, diminished, and augmented triads from a root note and how their inversions are formed.",
    "transcript": "Okay, so what is a chord? A chord is just multiple notes played at the same time. For example, if I play a C on the piano, that's just a note. But if I play a C, an E, and a G at the same time, that's a C major chord. It's a type of triad, which is a specific type of chord built with three notes.\\n\\nToday, we're going to talk about the four basic types of triads: major, minor, diminished, and augmented. They're all built using a root, a third, and a fifth.\\n\\nA major triad is built with a root, a major third, and a perfect fifth. For C, the major third is E, and the perfect fifth is G. So, C-E-G is a C major chord.\\n\\nA minor triad has a root, a minor third, and a perfect fifth. So, we take our C major chord and lower the third by a half step. C, E-flat, and G. That's a C minor chord.\\n\\nA diminished triad is a root, a minor third, and a diminished fifth. We take our minor chord and lower the fifth by a half step. C, E-flat, and G-flat. That's a C diminished chord.\\n\\nAn augmented triad is a root, a major third, and an augmented fifth. So we take our major chord and raise the fifth by a half step. C, E, and G-sharp. That's a C augmented chord.\\n\\nNow let's talk about inversions. When the root of the chord is the lowest note, it's in root position. If we take that root and move it to the top, so the third is now the lowest note, we get the first inversion. If we then take that third and move it to the top, so the fifth is the lowest note, we get the second inversion. It's the same chord, just with a different note in the bass.",
    "spec": "Build me an interactive web app to help a learner understand triads and their inversions.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\n1. The app must feature an interactive keyboard. When a key is pressed, the corresponding note should sound.\n2. The app must allow the user to select a root note (C, D, E, F, G, A, or B).  This root note should be displayed clearly. The root note should default to C.\n3. The app must have difficulty levels. 'Easy' shows Major/Minor triads. 'Medium' adds Diminished/Augmented. 'Hard' adds 7th chords.\n4. The app must allow the user to select an inversion (Root position, First Inversion, Second Inversion). The inversion should be displayed clearly. The inversion should default to Root Position.\n5. Based on the selected root, triad type, and inversion, the app must highlight the corresponding notes on the keyboard.  The notes should also sound.\n6. The app must display the formula for generating the triad in terms of intervals (e.g., for C Major, it should display 'Root: C, Third: Major Third, Fifth: Perfect Fifth').

    "summary": "This video explains the challenge of representing a 3D spherical Earth on a 2D flat map, introducing the concept of map projections and showing how the popular Mercator projection distorts the size of landmasses near the poles.",
    "transcript": "You can't flatten an orange peel without stretching or tearing it. The same problem applies to mapping the Earth. Every flat map has some distortion. The Mercator projection, which you see everywhere, is great for navigation because it preserves angles, so straight lines are constant compass bearings. But it has a huge problem: it massively distorts area. Greenland looks as big as Africa on a Mercator map, but in reality, Africa is 14 times larger.",
    "spec": "Build an interactive map projection visualizer.\\n\\nSPECIFICATIONS:\\n1. The app must display a 3D globe and a 2D map side-by-side.\\n2. The app must have difficulty levels. 'Easy' shows the standard Mercator projection and allows the user to drag a country on one to see its distorted size on the other. 'Medium' allows switching between different projections (e.g., Mercator, Peters, Robinson). 'Hard' adds Tissot's indicatrix (circles) to the globe to visually demonstrate how each projection distorts shape, area, and angle.",
